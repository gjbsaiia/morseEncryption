## morseEncryption
silly script I wrote that can take inputted text, or a .txt file </br>
and encrypts it using a keyword cypher (you're prompted for the keyword)</br>
it then uses the morse alphabet to encode this data into a .wav file. </br>
</br>
it's essentially a super geeky way to send secret messages. </br>
encodeMorseEnc.py is preset to make the smallest .wav file that </br>
decodeMorse.py can interpret. This means that if you listen to the </br>
.wav file, it sounds like static. </br>
However, encodeMorse.py gives you the option to set the "dit" speed (in ms) -</br>
this will allow to make human translatable, non-encrypted morse .wav files.</br>
</br>
Enjoy!
