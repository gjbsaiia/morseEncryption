## morseEncryption
silly script I wrote that can take inputted text, or a .txt file </br>
and then it uses the morse alphabet to encode this data into a .wav file. </br>
</br>
I've also written scripts that ask you for a keyword, and then use a</br>
keyword cypher to ecrypt your messages before encoding them into morse</br>
</br>
It's essentially a super geeky way to send secret messages. </br>
You have the option to set the "dit" speed (in ms) -</br>
this allows you to make human translatable morse messages</br>
or non-human translatable morse messages (dits too fast to understand)!</br>
</br>
The fastest dit speed you can set is 2ms per dit! This means that if you listen to the </br>
.wav file, it sounds like static. </br>
This limit is due to the ability of my program to accurately decode the message,</br>
but if you can modify my code and get the dit speed smaller - message me!</br>
</br>
All morse messages (in .wav file form) can be decoded with decodeMorse.py.</br>
All keyword encrypted morse messages can be decoded with decodeMorseEnc.py.<br>
</br>
Enjoy!
